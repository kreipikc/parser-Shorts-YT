### What kind of project is this?
This is a script parser for YouTube short films. The work takes place in the console (without a graphical interface). When you enter a link to a page with a brief description of the channel you need, the script analyzes the names, links and the number of views of all shorts on this channel.


### What did I use?
- Python
- selenium (library)
- webdriver_manager (library)

The entire project is written in python and stored in a single file main.py.


### Why did I even start creating this project?
The project was created for personal use and practice of writing a python parser.
